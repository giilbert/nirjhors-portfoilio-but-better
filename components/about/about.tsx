          Hello! My name is Charlus Dogun Worth, and I saved the world at the
          age of 5. Shortly afterwards, I invented the concept of time and
          space. By the age of 10, i won four nobel prize awards for services to
          the galaxy. by the age of 14, i was the first human to set foot on
          mars. <br /> 2 years later, I have decided to settle down and pursue a
          career in software development. in the past two years, I have worked
          at Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Shopify, spotify,
          jetbrains and linode. now, I am a multi-trillionaire who wakes up at 3
          aM every morning and goes to bed yesterday. <br />
          Technologies Iâ€™m familiar with:
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>Typescript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
